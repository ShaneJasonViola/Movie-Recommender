# ðŸŽ¬ Mood-Based Movie Recommender

This project recommends movies based on your mood. You just type in how youâ€™re feeling, and the app uses AI + movie data from TMDB to give you a short list of movies you might like. It generates a movie poster, a description of the movie and a link to watch a trailer.

The app is built  in Python using **Streamlit**, the **TMDB API** for movie info, and **OpenAIâ€™s API** to make the recommendations.

---

## What it Does
- You tell it your mood (happy, sad, bored, motivated, etc.).
- It gives you 3 movie suggestions that fit your vibe.
- Shows a poster, description, and release year for each movie
- Links you straight to the trailer so you can start watching faster.

## Why I Made It
I wanted to mix AI with a public API to make something useful but also fun to use  
Also, sometimes picking a movie is harder than actually watching one â€” so I thought Iâ€™d make that decision easier.

## How to Run It

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mood-based-movie-recommender.git
   cd mood-based-movie-recommender
   ```

2. **Install the requirements**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your API keys**  
   Make a file at `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and put this inside:
   ```toml
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
   TMDB_API_KEY = "your_tmdb_api_key"
   ```

4. **Run it!**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

- **Streamlit** â€“ to build the website
- **TMDB API** â€“ for all the movie info and posters
- **OpenAI API** â€“ to get mood-based suggestions
